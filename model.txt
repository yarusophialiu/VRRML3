this is to record the performance of each models

# model1 
input: reference only, ref, resolution, bitrate
output: fps and resolution
validation performance: 100% accuracy
test performance: 100% accuracy
notes: changed optimizer from sgd to adam
saved model: 2024-05-05/14_26/classification_ref_adam.pth
concern: only remembers the relationship between bitrate and targets
generalization to new scene: ï¼Ÿ
    for fast speed
    for normal/slow speed
    for mix speed
